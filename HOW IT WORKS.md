# How .truespace Works

---

## The Idea

.truespace flips how the internet works. Instead of platforms studying you to serve ads, you teach .truespace what genuinely matters—and it responds with content aligned with your real interests.

No tracking. No manipulation. Just a private space that evolves with you.

---

## Four Steps

### 1. Share What Matters
Use the app or browser extension to save content that resonates: articles, videos, images, quotes, or notes. This isn't about liking or reacting—it's about consciously identifying what matters to you.

### 2. Build Your Profile
.truespace creates a picture of your interests, values, and preferences. This profile is encrypted, stored only for you, and never shared with anyone.

### 3. Discover and React
When you're ready to explore, .truespace surfaces recommendations based on your authentic interests—quality content vetted for substance, not engagement metrics. React to what you see: your feedback directly shapes your profile and improves future recommendations.

### 4. Evolve Over Time
Every reaction contributes to your profile. Save what resonates, dismiss what doesn't—each choice helps .truespace understand you better. As you change, your space adapts with you.
